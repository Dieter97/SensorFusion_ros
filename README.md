# LiDAR and Camera sensor fusion for 2D and 3D object detection

This repo contains the ROS modules of my masters thesis

First make a new catkin workspace

```
mkdir -p catkin_ws_sensorfusion/src
cd catkin_ws_sensorfusion/src

```

To download:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dieter97/SensorFusion_ros.git
```

To compile
```
cd ../..
catkin_make
```

Now you can launch any of the launch files located in catkin_ws_sensorfusion/src/SensorFusion_ros/launch
